## Demo

A live demo and examples can be found [here](https://your-demo-url.example.com).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.x or Python >= 3.8 (depending on your runtime)
- npm or yarn (for JavaScript runtime)
- virtualenv or pipenv (for Python runtime)
- Access to an OpenAI API key or other language model provider.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-chatbot.git
cd agentic-ai-chatbot
```

#### JavaScript Runtime

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### Python Runtime

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Copy the sample environment file and set your API keys and options:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env and add your keys
```

Key environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI or compatible LLM API key.
- `MODEL_NAME`: The default language model (e.g., `gpt-4`).
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (e.g., `info`, `debug`).

## Usage

Start the chatbot in interactive mode:

```bash
npm start
# or
python main.py
```

Use the REST API (if enabled):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello, Agent!"}'
```

## Architecture Overview

1. **Core Engine**: Manages conversational context, planning, and execution of tasks.
2. **LLM Interface**: Abstraction layer for calling different language model providers.
3. **Plugin Manager**: Dynamically loads and executes plugins for extended functionality.
4. **Workflow Engine**: Defines and runs multi-step workflows based on triggers and conditions.
5. **API Layer**: Exposes HTTP endpoints for integration with other services.
6. **Persistence**: Stores conversation history, logs, and analytics data.

## Plugin Development

1. Create a new plugin file in `./plugins`:

```js
// plugins/example.js
module.exports = {
  name: "example",
  description: "An example plugin.",
  async execute({ context, args }) {
    // Plugin logic here
    return { success: true, data: "Example result" };
  },
};
```

2. Register your plugin in `config/plugins.js`:

```js
module.exports = [
  require("./plugins/example.js"),
  // ... other plugins
];
```

3. Use it within a workflow or directly via the API.

## Testing

Run unit and integration tests:

```bash
npm test
# or
pytest
```

Lint and format:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
# or
flake8 .
black .
```
